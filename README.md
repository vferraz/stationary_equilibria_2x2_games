# Stationary Equilibria in Behavioral Game Theory

This repository contains all materials related to the paper "Stationary Equilibria in Behavioral Game Theory: An Experimental Analysis of Inspection Games." Our research assesses the predictive power of various stationary equilibrium concepts within inspector games, incorporating behavioral modifications to explore the impact of loss aversion and fairness parameters.

## Project Structure

- `equilibria_computation/`: Contains data samples, experiments data (`data_inspector_game/`), and data from Selten & Chmura 2008 (`data_selten/`). It also includes Jupyter notebooks:
  - `original_stationary_equilibria.ipynb`: Reproduces theoretical stationary equilibria concepts.
  - `modified_stationary_equilibria.ipynb`: Features modified equilibria models with behavioral parameters.
- `plots_and_data_analysis/`: This folder houses raw data, data aggregations for analysis, and notebooks for statistical analyses and plotting.

## Usage

- For equilibria computations, navigate to `equilibria_computation/` and open the respective Jupyter notebooks.
- To perform data analysis and generate plots, go to `plots_and_data_analysis/` and follow the instructions within.
